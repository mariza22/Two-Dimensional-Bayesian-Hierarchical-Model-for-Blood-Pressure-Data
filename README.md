# Two-Dimensional-Bayesian-Hierarchical-Model-for-Blood-Pressure-Data
In the two-Dimensional Bayesian Hierarchical model we use a two-Dimensional  Intrinsic Gaussian Markov Random Field (IGMRF) as a prior distribution. IGMRF is used to take into account the interaction between the Diastolic and Systolic Blood Pressure ( DBP and SBP respectively) throught out the years under study.
